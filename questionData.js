    questionDis:
      "The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. For example, if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the maximum profit can earned by buying on day 0, selling on day 3. Again buy on day 4 and sell on day 6. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, then profit cannot be earned at all.",

    questionDis:
      "A simple solution is to consider every pair and keep track of closest pair (absolute difference between pair sum and x is minimum). Finally print the closest pair. Time complexity of this solution is O(n2). An efficient solution can find the pair in O(n) time.The idea is similar to method 2 of this post.Following is detailed algorithm.",
